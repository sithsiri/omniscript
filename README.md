# omniscript
My idea of simple script. I still barely started it.

  The idea is for it to be compatible with any script, and be able to run anywhere. I will add versions for specifications as I go, and suggestions are welcome. Alpha will mean that the spec is not set in stone. Go ahead and check it out!
